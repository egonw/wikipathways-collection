## DataNodesTests.dataNodesWithoutIdentifier

The following DataNodes have no identifier: 1
```
http://www.wikipathways.org/instance/WP2626_r117375 http://rdf.wikipathways.org/Pathway/WP2626_r117375/DataNode/d4662 (Accumulation of ABA during seed development has been associated with maturation of the seed, 
development of desiccation tolerance and suppression of vivipary. Rapid increases of ABA has 
also been linked to water stress-induced closure of stomata.)
```

## DataNodesTests.unknownTypes

The following DataNodes have Unknown @Type: 1
```

## HMDBMetabolitesTests.correctFormat

I expected more than zero HMDB identifiers.
